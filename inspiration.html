            The way the face seems to come off the ‘page’ in this design is an interesting 3D effect. It's a collage
            type
            of
            effect but is done subtly enough so as to support the seriousness of the design. This serious aura is
            done
            well
            through the primary use of beige, clean geometric shapes, and a greyscale, high-fidelity face. This might
            be
            the
            engaging, trendier front to a journal or something of the sort.

            Isolating the skater from the shot to the graphical part of the design helps emphasise the skater as the
            center
            focus of the design, otherwise given the grayscale theme, it would be hard to distinguish the skater.
            This
            effect
            also sparks the viewer to imagine the rest of the shot, making the design engaging. Everything else in
            this
            design, scale, whitespace, symmetry, mood etc. is also done right.

            I like the idea in this design of an arbitrary shape or pattern acting as a window to content underneath.
            In particular I like the way the spiral creates a series of small windows of varying sizes, segregating
            the
            design
            to make it easy for the user's attention to sensically explore the design's content. I think this could
            be
            really
            effective in a website where the swirl can be moved around using the cursor, showing different snippets
            of
            underlying content.

            Usually, graphical typography has a rigid structure and defined manipulatable aspects.This is not often
            significantly tampered with. This design meddles with that idea by slicing letters and moving them around
            as
            if they’re made out of paper. Treating graphical elements as though they’re on paper and can be cut by
            scissors is an idea I can see has great potential.

            The above three designs are examples of formal and simple, yet engaging design. They focus on using
            shapes
            and lines in creative ways to make the design interesting, I can see a presence of Gestalts’ principles
            which order and structure the designs. Furthermore, using these shapes and lines as axes for text add
            structure and help unify the design. These show great ways of creating designs which need to accommodate
            for
            fair amounts of text.

            There are a couple of things I really like about this design. Variation in the colour tones and hues are
            confined to shapes formed by overlapping lines This makes for the emergence of interesting pictures and
            perplexing depth. The text is also very well distinguished and emphasised, and the variation in shapes
            and
            texture used further improve the design.

            I really like the chaotic, yet almost seemingly geometric typography of this design. There seems to be no
            care for a clean colour palette, letters are of all sizes and shapes, sometimes overlaid onto themselves
            and
            positioned all over. A fair use of whitespace prevents the design from becoming overwhelming. Style like
            this could be really interesting in website design, and would most certainly make it stand out.

            This design, I think, uses textures well to add aesthetic to the design, what with the sandpapered
            effects.
            It is almost reminiscent of some 2000s design that floated around tv shows like RAGE. However, its use of
            collage helps distinguish it. The hand drawn typography is rarely seen in conventional designs.

         <div class="inspiration-annotation annotation" id="annotation14">I like this design quite simply because it
            is
            chaotic and experimental. I have no idea what it is abou. It is a weird jumbled collage of illustrated
            typographic elements, cleaner figure illustrations, and a background which fails to add any context,
            however
            it is completely unique. I think these aspects of the design have a lot of potential to add creative and
            unique styles to a design.</div>

            This design has a very authentic and original aesthetic. It uses an wide colour palette in an
            unconventional, somewhat abstract textured blending style. The loose illustration style and nonsensical
            combination of these illustrations (stacked buildings and a surfer thing) are unlike any other designs
            I’ve
            seen and make for impactful branding for quicksilver. It’s clear that this design also isn’t attempting
            to
            be vintage because it uses clean cut typography.

            I like the way this design uses some unique layering to make it interesting. Centering all three of the
            layers gives the impression of the center image being the focus with the other layers being large borders
            almost. Using an image as the second layer keeps the design interesting but the heavy orange tint stops
            is
            from becoming overwhelming. The nike swoosh is unobtrusive but clear, and repetition helps reinforce the
            message.

            This design only realises a few simple means of distinguishing elements and organizing the content to
            guide
            the viewer's attention in the desired way such that the end design is integral and organized. It uses
            font
            style, weight and size to create emphasis and also orders content from left to right, the direction
            people
            read. This and a good use of lines segregates the content well.Slanting the box and underlaying the nike
            swoosh add creative elements that also keep the design interesting without making it messy.

         <div class="inspiration-annotation annotation" id="annotation18">
            I really like this design because it uses some really characteristic artistic elements and composes them,
            as
            well as an image, together with intelligent respect to proportionality and alignment. The smoothly
            flowing
            3D style of the word pro mimics the flow of waves, adding to the surfer style of the poster. The
            background
            illustration is reminiscent of hawaiian culture and is also a recurring style in quicksilver designs. The
            all together dimly warm colour palette of the poster is again suggestive of the buoyant surfing culture.
            The
            graphical use of straight lines and clean squares in composing the design shows that this design is also
            modern.
