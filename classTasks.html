            The coca cola logo is defined almost solely by
            its typography.
            The letters are slanted in cursive and the tails all tend to move in the same direction. As a result the
            whole logo feels like it's leaning or being pulled to the side, making it flow and helping it to
            communicate
            that it’s a ‘whole’.</div>

            The adidas logo and brand in general is characterized by its
            three stripes. In this logo they are identifiable and thus seen as a group but are of different heights.
            The
            result is a communicated incline synonymous with a mountain or the grind to success.</div>

         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation4">
            In this logo, the shapes are symmetrically divided into two groups of three and thus gives the impression
            of
            the logo having two halves. This is made apparent by the amount of space between the middle two shapes
            being
            slightly more than that between any other two, and thus breaking them apart.
         </div>
         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation5">
            This logo blends two different shapes into one making it hard to distinguish which is the foreground or
            subject of the logo and which is the background. As a result they both take on both roles simultaneously
            and
            can change depending on which you look at. This is the desired effect in this logo and the result is a
            more
            interesting design
         </div>
         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation6">
            In this logo all of the rings are clustered together. This clearly establishes them as a part of one
            group.
            They also have the same shape and thus use similarity to further establish them as a group. This conveys
            messages of diversity and unification.

            The Apple logo consists of only two basic black shapes to define itself as an apple. While being very
            simple, these shapes are highly distinguishable as the outlines of an apple. As such this logo uses
            simplicity so that when people look at it, they are reminded of an apple which when digested in its
            simplest
            form as the principle states, looks the same.
         </div>
         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation8">
            This logo uses basic, suggestive shapes in its use of typography to imply the existence of a greater
            defined
            shape, which is a shark. When looked at, the gaps between the letters are filled in, so that it feels
            like
            we see the solid shape of a shark. This makes the logo intriguing as it is suggestive rather than
            explicit
            and thus allows you to make the connection.

         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation9">
            The BP logo consists of shapes that appear to be layered and moving outwards like the petals of a flower.
            This suggests the continuity of lines starting in the middle and curving outwards. The result is a more
            defined and more communicative shape.

               My colours of choice for the album cover I designed are red, black and white (and some dark grey). Using
               these completely changed the mood portrayed by this design. The abstractly illustrated portrait
               incorporating some geometric shapes originally appeared weird at best. Perhaps seemingly a design taking
               influence from picasso, I perceived the mood of the original cover to be curious and contemplative.
               Colouring the cover with red, dark grey and black has transformed this mood into one of anger, hatred and
               violence. It leads me to expect the album to be edgy and moody. To demonstrate this contrast, I made
               another version of this album cover that used bright colours. The prevailing green annihilates the angry
               and demonic tones of the red version and instead adds a cheerful tone the the cover and the cover is
               instead subtly reminiscent of flowers.

               Following all the guidelines talked about in class and the methods learned in previous classes, you are
               required to re-design the Google Classroom Logo, incorporating a symbol. The symbol needs to represent
               this education app.
               The symbol and logotype should be designed to be one element, not a pictogram next to the words or
               letters, for example. Think about the positive and negative spaces created within and around letters, and
               how these may be utilised to create a symbol of some sort.
               The logo must be created in an Adobe software program – Illustrator or Photoshop.

            <div class="annotation" id="task3Evaluation">
               In the brief of this class task, I was tasked with redesigning the Google Classroom logo to represent the
               app as an educational platform. It was to be designed as a single element with consideration to the
               graphic design principles and elements and incorporate a distinguishable symbol. I believe my final
               solution meets this criteria and also includes other branding related aspects that further improve it.
               <br><br>
               To ensure this design is apt at all sizes, I used only thick lines, minimal detail and strong contrast. I
               aligned and scaled the books to balance the logo and unify it into a square shape. Both the G and C I
               vertically centred and aligned with the curves of the blue book, increasing the formality of the logo. I
               also used common shapes and avoided using any textures or artistic esque style to further its formality
               as a performing software platform. To identify google classroom as educational, I used 3 stacked books in
               this logo. Not only is this a common symbol for education, but it is also a universal symbol, that is, it
               is recognizable across the world. It is also simple and identifiable at all sizes. Furthermore, to ensure
               this is a modern logo I’ve complied with the conventional flat UI design principle and used pure,
               brightly contrasting colours.
               <br><br>
               An interesting flaw in the current Google Classroom logo is that it doesn’t use colours from the super
               identifiable google colour palette, unlike every other google logo. I assume this was done because
               otherwise the symbol of the logo would be hard to identify as a school blackboard. On the other hand,
               books are not bound by colour and so I was able to incorporate the google colours while still maintaining
               the recognisability of the symbol. Resultantly my logo now fits nicely into the suite of google logos and
               is immediately identifiable as a google logo.
               <br><br>
               Overall, I think my logo complies well with the design principles and elements, uses effective symbolism,
               and identifies well as a google logo. I am somewhat uncertain as to whether the book symbols are
               immediately distinguishable as books. I also think that in situations where a large version of the logo
               is used, it would benefit from having accompanying text saying ‘Google Classroom’ underneath. This would
               help people who are viewing the logo for the first time with defining it, and could considerably improve
               communication when, for example, the product is launching in a new area. Beyond these I can’t see any
               flaws in the execution of this design.
