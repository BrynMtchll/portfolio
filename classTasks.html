            The coca cola logo is defined almost solely by
            its typography.
            The letters are slanted in cursive and the tails all tend to move in the same direction. As a result the
            whole logo feels like it's leaning or being pulled to the side, making it flow and helping it to
            communicate
            that it’s a ‘whole’.</div>

            The adidas logo and brand in general is characterized by its
            three stripes. In this logo they are identifiable and thus seen as a group but are of different heights.
            The
            result is a communicated incline synonymous with a mountain or the grind to success.</div>

            In this logo, the shapes are symmetrically divided into two groups of three and thus gives the impression
            of
            the logo having two halves. This is made apparent by the amount of space between the middle two shapes
            being
            slightly more than that between any other two, and thus breaking them apart.
         </div>
         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation5">
            This logo blends two different shapes into one making it hard to distinguish which is the foreground or
            subject of the logo and which is the background. As a result they both take on both roles simultaneously
            and
            can change depending on which you look at. This is the desired effect in this logo and the result is a
            more

            In this logo all of the rings are clustered together. This clearly establishes them as a part of one
            group.
            They also have the same shape and thus use similarity to further establish them as a group. This conveys
            messages of diversity and unification.

            The Apple logo consists of only two basic black shapes to define itself as an apple. While being very
            simple, these shapes are highly distinguishable as the outlines of an apple. As such this logo uses
            simplicity so that when people look at it, they are reminded of an apple which when digested in its
            simplest
            form as the principle states, looks the same.

         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation8">
            This logo uses basic, suggestive shapes in its use of typography to imply the existence of a greater
            defined
            shape, which is a shark. When looked at, the gaps between the letters are filled in, so that it feels
            like
            we see the solid shape of a shark. This makes the logo intriguing as it is suggestive rather than
            explicit
            and thus allows you to make the connection.

         <div class="annotation task1Annotation" id="task1Annotation9">
            The BP logo consists of shapes that appear to be layered and moving outwards like the petals of a flower.
            This suggests the continuity of lines starting in the middle and curving outwards. The result is a more
            defined and more communicative shape.

               My colours of choice for the album cover I designed are red, black and white (and some dark grey). Using
               these completely changed the mood portrayed by this design. The abstractly illustrated portrait
               incorporating some geometric shapes originally appeared weird at best. Perhaps seemingly a design taking
               influence from picasso, I perceived the mood of the original cover to be curious and contemplative.
               Colouring the cover with red, dark grey and black has transformed this mood into one of anger, hatred and
               violence. It leads me to expect the album to be edgy and moody. To demonstrate this contrast, I made
               another version of this album cover that used bright colours. The prevailing green annihilates the angry
               and demonic tones of the red version and instead adds a cheerful tone the the cover and the cover is
               instead subtly reminiscent of flowers.

               Following all the guidelines talked about in class and the methods learned in previous classes, you are
               required to re-design the Google Classroom Logo, incorporating a symbol. The symbol needs to represent
               this education app.
               The symbol and logotype should be designed to be one element, not a pictogram next to the words or
               letters, for example. Think about the positive and negative spaces created within and around letters, and
               how these may be utilised to create a symbol of some sort.
               The logo must be created in an Adobe software program – Illustrator or Photoshop.

               In the brief of this class task, I was tasked with redesigning the Google Classroom logo to represent the
               app as an educational platform. It was to be designed as a single element with consideration to the
               graphic design principles and elements and incorporate a distinguishable symbol. I believe my final
               solution meets this criteria and also includes other branding related aspects that further improve it.
               <br><br>
               To ensure this design is apt at all sizes, I used only thick lines, minimal detail and strong contrast. I
               aligned and scaled the books to balance the logo and unify it into a square shape. Both the G and C I
               vertically centred and aligned with the curves of the blue book, increasing the formality of the logo. I
               also used common shapes and avoided using any textures or artistic esque style to further its formality
               as a performing software platform. To identify google classroom as educational, I used 3 stacked books in
               this logo. Not only is this a common symbol for education, but it is also a universal symbol, that is, it
               is recognizable across the world. It is also simple and identifiable at all sizes. Furthermore, to ensure
               this is a modern logo I’ve complied with the conventional flat UI design principle and used pure,
               brightly contrasting colours.
               <br><br>
               An interesting flaw in the current Google Classroom logo is that it doesn’t use colours from the super
               identifiable google colour palette, unlike every other google logo. I assume this was done because
               otherwise the symbol of the logo would be hard to identify as a school blackboard. On the other hand,
               books are not bound by colour and so I was able to incorporate the google colours while still maintaining
               the recognisability of the symbol. Resultantly my logo now fits nicely into the suite of google logos and
               is immediately identifiable as a google logo.
               <br><br>
               Overall, I think my logo complies well with the design principles and elements, uses effective symbolism,
               and identifies well as a google logo. I am somewhat uncertain as to whether the book symbols are
               immediately distinguishable as books. I also think that in situations where a large version of the logo
               is used, it would benefit from having accompanying text saying ‘Google Classroom’ underneath. This would
               help people who are viewing the logo for the first time with defining it, and could considerably improve
               communication when, for example, the product is launching in a new area. Beyond these I can’t see any
               flaws in the execution of this design.

               You are required to design a T-Shirt graphic for people aged 16-21. Your target market is your peers, so
               you will need to find out what they want. Do they want bright or dark colours? What styles do they like?
               Should there be a theme? What message do they want to send?
               <br>

               You need to follow the design process (brief, research, concepts, development, solution, evaluation,

               raster graphics in your design, all elements must be vector.

               Not one person I asked had specific preferences for colours, themes or designs that highlighted a
               specific design principle. The target audience is the age range where everyone is establishing their
               personal identities. It is also the age range where people are attempting to care less about what their
               peers think about them yet at the same time care a lot about whether their peers think they care. Hence a
               lot of people between the ages of 16 and 21 are focused on developing a unique, often edgy fashion style.
               This explains why the overwhelmingly dominant preference people had for Tshirt designs were for them to
               be original and unique. I’ve also noticed that people have a greater inkling towards unique illustration
               styles and illustrated characters.

               The brief for this task was to design a T-Shirt popular amongst my peers. To achieve this I established I
               would need to create a T-Shirt that compiled together an original exploration of design elements and
               ideas using both graphic and illustrative techniques. I also established that these explorations would
               need to come to some sort of finite conclusions so that the design doesn’t end out feeling lost.
               <br>
               <br>
               My first idea for the design was to explore hand drawn typography styles. I tried to overlay as many
               styles as possible, exploring the ways in which they can be distorted and warped yet still legible. I
               also layered letters in different styles and used lines and shapes to accent them. I did this simply
               because I haven’t seen it done before, beyond the work of David Carson. I then went on to compliment
               these letters with a handful of abstract shapes and patterns, which I used to tinker with depth and
               transparency.
               <br>
               <br>
               To compliment the laid back and casual air of the illustrations I coloured the design using a varied
               autumn colour palette. In particular I used some dim cool colours that transition into some dull pinks
               and yellows (plus some fluro green). This adds to the sporadic style of the illustration, but so that it
               isn’t too scattered I clustered similar colours to help distinguish each letter.
               <br>
               <br>
               I thought to help balance the design, it required an element of scale, so I added the central
               illustration. I scaled it up to have thick strokes and contain more negative space. This now serves as
               the central and initial focus of the design. I placed it in a rectangle to add some much needed negative
               space. Doing this also added some structure by segregating the illustrations into chunks. The white fill
               of the central illustration and dull monotone background colour contrast nicely with the more chaotic
               elements above and below. I further boxed all of these elements together with a rectangle in an attempt
               to unify the design.
               <br>
               <br>
               As some final touches I added some graphical boxes and typography to the top left whose alignment and
               cleanness contrast nicely. I lacked any inspiration for meaningful text and wanted to refrain from using
               random words (a choice I somewhat regret when drafting the initial illustration of capital), so I used
               the water ratings url for because it adds a humorous element to the design and makes it somewhat edgier.
               <br>
               <br>
               I wonder if because I have slowly developed each of the elements in this design, I have become accustomed
               to them and as a result the design seems more familiar and simpler to me than to others. I fear that it
               may seem too chaotic and complex to others, Its exploration of so many ideas simultaneously may make it
               appear lost. I think that this design would do better if it existed as a later development, a new
               arrangement of illustrations and ideas already familiar. That way, my peers would be able to explore each
               idea sequentially and methodically, the way I did, thus making the final design more sensicle. I would
               also have liked to improve the alignment of this design because I feel that its balance between chaos and
               structure is not quite level.
               <br>
               <br>
               In future I think there is still much room for exploration with the elements of this design. One area I
               omitted exploring was texture, some hard sandpaper esque textures could have really helped solidify this
               design. I would like to trail different arrangements and alignments and also explore some visual ideas
               like masks and windows, which could help simplify the design and make it more proportional. However
               overall I consider this design to be successful and confidently think it matches the brief.

               In the brief for this task, I was tasked with creating a poster for the school production. I wanted the
               poster to capture the lighthearted and cheerful nature of the play and of course include some elements
               which hint at what it’s about.
               <br><br>
               Drawing from the other spelling bee posters, I considered a stage and a microphone to be the best way to
               reflect the play and as it’s a play about words, I thought books would be a good complement. I further
               included a spotlight as a way of creating depth and visual interest, but also as a symbolic reference to
               the theatrical intensity and pressure of a solo performance.
               <br><br>
               The play seems to center around strong school based stereotypes. To match this theme I focused on giving
               the poster a stereotypical casual arts and craft style, a style that would be well supported by the
               predefined colour palette. Inspired from the other spelling bee posters, I hand drew a custom font for
               the words ‘Spelling Bee’ that look as though they were drawn with a marker, I textured the purple
               background such that it appears to be a material, and I added virtual white paint splatters to the
               microphone. Furthering the amateurish craft style of this poster, I included elements that suggest depth
               but in unrealistic ways; the books are stacked with isometric depth yet have no effect on the lighting of
               each other and the microphone placed on top is visibly flat, and there’s apparent light shining on the
               books and microphone yet there are no lighter tones where the light should be hitting and no shadows are
               cast. To signify that these are deliberate effects, I contrast them with a folded paper effect with
               realistic shadows. Finally I used a typewriter font for all of the accompanying text as yet another craft
               styled element.
               <br><br>
               Balance and emphasis were two leading priorities I had for this design in order to achieve quick and
               clear communication. I scaled the words ‘Spelling Bee’ to be the most prominent element of the design,
               setting up the context for the illustrations, which are of similar emphasis but take up a smaller area.
               All text (including the text on the back if you follow the isometric path) is aligned along the same
               margins. To unify the smaller blocks of text, I include blue rectangles in their margins. This also helps
               guide the users attention from one to the other in a left, right, left fashion that helps provide
               balance. I used colour to group elements and create contrast in other areas as well. The books and
               microphone are distinguished by the white surrounds, and ‘Spelling Bee’ is unified with yellow. In their
               multi colouring, the books also appear more strongly as one group.
               <br><br>
               The design I have created I think fits the brief aptly, however in reflective hindsight, I see a couple
               of things that could be improved upon. I opted to not include a character to avoid the risk of over
               cluttering the poster, however I think using a character instead of the microphone could have been more
               reflective of the play. On another note, while there is adequate negative space in the poster, I think
               scaling down the books, microphone and spotlight and increasing negative space would make the poster
               visually easier to digest. It would also further enhance the depth and distance communicated in the
               poster. Lastly, I think some subtle texture additions could possibly have improved the poster; adding
               some streaks along the spotlight and slightly embossing the words ‘Spelling Bee’.
